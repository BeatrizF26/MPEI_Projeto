# MPEI Project
This project aims to assess wheter a finacial transaction could be considered faudulent or legitimate. To achieve this we applied some probabilistic methods, including:
- ***Naive Bayes:*** Used to calculate the probability of a transaction being fraudulent based on historical attributes.
- ***Bloom Filter:*** Used to check if a transaction has been done before, helping to identify suspicious patterns.
- ***MinHash:*** Used to measure similarity between transactions, detecting fraud through identifying similar patterns.
